			<h3>Exploration. Navigation. Transportation.</h3>
			<p>When people ask what we focus on with the kids, those three words come to mind.</p>
			<p>Exploration of their communities. Navigation around the City so they know how to get there on their own. Transportation to parks, the pool, their friends houses and school.</p>
