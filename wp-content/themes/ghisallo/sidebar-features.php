			<h3>Vision and Mission</h3>
			<img src="http://placehold.it/350x250">
			<p>We envision a community where youth become expert cyclists who grow to become lifelong, safety-conscious riders.</p>
			<p>Our primary mission is to develop youth who safely and expertly integrate bicycling into their daily lives, to teach participants self sufficient cycling skills, and to facilitate the experience needed for youth cyclists to be peer leaders.</p>

			<h3>Exploration. Navigation. Transportation.</h3>
			<p>When people ask what we focus on with the kids, those three words come to mind.</p>
			<p>Exploration of their communities. Navigation around the City so they know how to get there on their own. Transportation to parks, the pool, their friends houses and school.</p>
